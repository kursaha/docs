# MongoDB 

The MongoDB Connector seamlessly integrates your MongoDB database with our platform, enabling efficient data interaction, management, and replication. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process to set up and utilize the connector effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Access to Your MongoDB Database**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to connect and interact with the database.
- **Host Address**: The hostname or IP address of your MongoDB server.
- **Port Number**: Typically `27017` for MongoDB, unless configured otherwise.
- **Database Name**: The specific database you intend to connect to or replicate.
- **Credentials**: A valid username and password with appropriate access rights.
- **Authentication Source**: Usually `"admin"`, unless your MongoDB setup specifies otherwise.
- **TLS/SSL Requirements**: Determine if your MongoDB server requires a secure TLS connection.

## Features

- **Secure Connection**: Connect to your MongoDB database securely using TLS if required.
- **Automatic Schema Discovery**: Automatically identifies and describes your database collections and their structures.
- **Data Querying**: Execute queries to retrieve specific data from your MongoDB collections.
- **Efficient Data Streaming**: Stream large datasets efficiently, ensuring optimal performance.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Navigate to the Connector Creation Page

1. **Access the Platform**:
    - Log in to your account on our platform.

2. **Navigate to Data Sources**:
    - Go to `Home` > `Data Source` > `New`.

3. **Create Connector**:
    - You will be directed to the **"Create Connector"** page.

### 2. Enter Basic Information

1. **Name**:
    - Enter a **unique and descriptive** name for your connector (e.g., `SalesDB Connector`).

2. **Data Type**:
    - Select **"MONGODB"** from the dropdown menu.

### 3. Specify MongoDB Source Details

Fill in the following fields accurately:

1. **Host**:
    - Enter the hostname or IP address of your MongoDB server.
    - **Examples**:
        - `mongodb.example.com`
        - `192.168.1.100`

2. **Port**:
    - Enter the port number your MongoDB server is running on.
    - **Default**: `27017`

3. **Database Name**:
    - Enter the name of the specific database you want to connect to.
    - **Note**: This is case-sensitive.

4. **User**:
    - Enter the username with access to the specified database.

5. **Password**:
    - Enter the password associated with the username.
    - **Security Tip**: Ensure you're in a secure environment when entering sensitive information.

6. **Authentication Source**:
    - Typically set to `"admin"`.
    - This is the database where the user credentials are stored.
    - **Note**: Adjust if your MongoDB setup uses a different authentication source.

7. **TLS Connection**:
    - **Check** this box if your MongoDB server requires a secure TLS connection.
    - **Uncheck** if unsure or if TLS is not used.
    - **Recommendation**: Consult your database administrator if uncertain.

### 4. Save and Validate the Configuration

1. **Save Configuration**: After filling in all required fields, click the **"SAVE"** button located in the top right corner.

2. **Validation**:
    - The system will automatically validate your configuration to ensure a successful connection to your MongoDB instance.
    - **Success**: You'll receive a confirmation message indicating the connector is set up correctly.
    - **Failure**: Review the error message, double-check your entries, and attempt to save again.

## Using the Connector

Once configured, leverage the MongoDB Connector to enhance your data operations:

1. **Discover Schemas**:
    - Automatically identify and describe the collections within your database.

2. **Query Data**:
    - Execute queries to retrieve specific datasets from your MongoDB collections.

3. **Stream Data**:
    - Efficiently stream large datasets, ensuring optimal performance and minimal latency.

4. **Data Retrieval by ID**:
    - Fetch specific records using their unique identifiers for precise data operations.

## Best Practices

1. **Security**:
    - **Dedicated User Account**: Use a dedicated read-only account for the connector with only necessary permissions.
    - **Password Management**: Regularly update passwords and avoid using admin accounts for connector operations.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
    - **Indexing**: Index frequently queried fields in your MongoDB database to enhance query performance.
    - **Efficient Queries**: Design queries thoughtfully to minimize load and maximize speed, especially on large collections.

3. **Configuration Management**:
    - **Update Connector Settings**: If there are changes to your MongoDB setup (e.g., password changes, host updates), promptly update your connector configuration.
    - **Monitor Performance**: Regularly monitor connector performance and adjust configurations as needed.

4. **Network Considerations**:
    - **Firewall Rules**: Ensure our platform's IP addresses are whitelisted in your MongoDB server's firewall settings to allow seamless connections.

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Follow these steps to resolve common problems:

### 1. Configuration Errors

- **Double-Check Entries**:
    - Verify all entered information, especially the **Host**, **Port**, **Database Name**, **User**, and **Password**.

- **User Permissions**:
    - Ensure the user has the necessary permissions to access and interact with the specified database and collections.

### 2. Connection Issues

- **Firewall and Network**:
    - Confirm that our platform's IP addresses are whitelisted in your MongoDB server's firewall rules.

- **Server Accessibility**:
    - Ensure the MongoDB server is running and accessible from external connections.

- **TLS Requirements**:
    - Verify if TLS is required and that the **TLS Connection** option is correctly set.

### 3. Data Retrieval Problems

- **Database and Collections**:
    - Ensure the specified database and collections exist and are correctly named.

- **User Permissions**:
    - Confirm that the user has the appropriate read permissions for the collections being accessed.

- **Query Issues**:
    - Review your queries for accuracy and efficiency, ensuring they align with your data structure.

### 4. Validation Failures

- **Error Messages**:
    - Carefully read any error messages provided during the validation process for specific guidance.

- **Re-enter Credentials**:
    - Sometimes, simply re-entering credentials can resolve transient issues.
