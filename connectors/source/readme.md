These connectors are designed to establish connections with different types of data sources such as databases, APIs, cloud services, and file systems. By leveraging source connectors, you can seamlessly fetch and integrate data from these sources into our platform, allowing for comprehensive data analysis, processing, and utilization. These connectors eliminate the need for manual data entry and enable automated and efficient data ingestion, ensuring a smooth and reliable data integration process.
