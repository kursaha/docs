# Audience Prediction for Product Campaign using Real-Time Events

## Introduction

In this case study, we will explore how Kursaha, a leading AI-powered customer engagement platform, leverages real-time user events such as views, add-to-cart, and purchases to train its predictive model. The objective is to demonstrate how this model helps businesses accurately predict and target the most relevant audiences for a specific product campaign, leading to higher conversion rates and improved ROI.

## The Challenge

For businesses running product campaigns, identifying the right target audience is crucial for success. Traditional targeting methods often rely on static audience segments, resulting in limited personalization and suboptimal campaign performance. Kursaha aims to address this challenge by leveraging real-time user behavior data to create dynamic and highly accurate audience predictions.

## The Solution

1. **Real-Time Event Tracking**: Kursaha's platform is integrated with client websites and applications, enabling real-time tracking of user interactions such as product views, add-to-cart actions, and purchases. This data is continuously fed into the predictive model, ensuring up-to-date and accurate insights.

2. **Dynamic Audience Segmentation**: The collected real-time data is used to dynamically segment users based on their engagement levels and intent. Kursaha's model identifies users with high purchase intent and predicts their likelihood of converting, enabling the creation of custom audience segments.

3. **Model Training**: Kursaha's AI-driven algorithms continuously analyze the real-time user data and train the predictive model. The model learns from historical data and adapts to changing user behaviors, making it robust and capable of identifying potential customers accurately.

4. **Audience Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it predicts the likelihood of conversion for each user based on their real-time event history. Users are assigned a predictive score, indicating their probability of making a purchase.

5. **Campaign Targeting**: Armed with audience predictions, businesses can precisely target users with high conversion probability for the product campaign. Kursaha's platform seamlessly integrates with various advertising channels, allowing clients to execute targeted campaigns across multiple platforms.

## The Results
