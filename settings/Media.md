Kursaha’s Media Feature simplifies the way you handle and share media files. With our easy-to-use tool, you can quickly upload your media—whether it’s images, videos, or documents—and receive a public URL for each file.

## How to upload and use

1. Go to the Settings page -> Media section.
2. Click on Create New Button.
3. Enter a media name for identification purposes.
4. Upload the Media, you want to use in app.
5. Click on the "Save" button.
6. Click on view, to get the public url of the particular media.

Once uploaded succesfully, you can use this url in [Template Push notification](../template/PushNotification.md/#3-add-an-image) etc.
