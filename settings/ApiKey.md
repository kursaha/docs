## How to Generate and Use a API Key

This guide explains how to generate a Kursaha API key and how to use it for authentication purposes. Before you begin, please make sure you have a Kursaha account. If you don't have one, please create an account or reachout to support@kursaha.com.

## Generating a API Key

### To create a new API key, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the Settings page -> API Key section.
2. Click on Create New API Key Button.
3. Enter a key name for identification purposes.
4. Click on the "Save" button to generate the API key.

Once you have successfully generated a API key, make sure to store it securely. Please note that for security reasons, Kursaha does not store the API key on its server.

##### Using the API Key

The Kursaha API key is a secret key that you can use for authentication purposes when interacting with Kursaha through the API. You can use our [MailSdk](../developer/MailSdk.md) or [EddSdk](../developer/readme.md) to integrate it into your application.

**Keep in mind that the Kursaha API key should be treated as a sensitive information and should not be shared with anyone who doesn't need access to it.**
