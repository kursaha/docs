#### **2. Develop a Template**

**What It Is:** This template will be having the content of your OTP message. It includes the OTP code and any necessary instructions or information. Be sure to use a correct placeholder format

- **How to Do It:** Write a concise message that includes the OTP code placeholder and any additional information. Ensure the message is clear and instructive.

**Notes:**

- **Placeholder:** Use correct placeholder format `[(${OTP})]` that will be replaced with the actual OTP code when sent.
- **Clarity:** Make sure the message clearly informs the recipient of the purpose of the OTP and any actions they need to take.

#### **3. Test Your OTP Template**

**What It Is:** Testing ensures that your OTP template functions correctly and that the message is delivered as intended.

- **How to Do It:** Send a test message using the OTP template to verify that the OTP placeholder is correctly replaced and that the message content appears as expected.

**Why It Matters:** Testing helps confirm that the OTP is delivered properly and that users receive clear instructions, preventing potential issues during the verification process.

Using OTP templates effectively ensures a smooth and secure verification process for your users. By creating well-structured OTP messages, you can enhance security, improve user experience, and streamline authentication procedures.
