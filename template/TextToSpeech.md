The **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** feature in Kursaha is designed to convert written text into natural-sounding spoken language, enhancing your communication strategy with dynamic, audible messages. This feature supports four different languages—**English, Hindi, Bengali,** and **Arabic**—allowing you to reach a diverse audience with localized, accessible content.

## How It Works

### 1. **Name for Template**

When creating a template, selecting a clear and descriptive name is essential for distinguishing it and ensuring easy access.

### 2. **Language Options**

- **English**
- **Hindi**
- **Arabic**
- **Bengali**

### 3. **Wrapper Template Integration**

- **Create a Wrapper Template**: Develop a template that defines the context and structure for your text-to-speech messages. This wrapper ensures that your audio messages are delivered in a consistent and professional format.
- **Embed TTS in WhatsApp**: Integrate the text-to-speech functionality within WhatsApp communications. When users receive a message, they will see an option to listen to the message as an audio file rather than reading the text.
- **Audio Conversion**: The text included in the wrapper template will be automatically converted into audio in the selected language. This conversion ensures that messages are accessible to users who prefer or require auditory content.

## Benefits of Text-to-Speech

#### **Enhanced Accessibility**

- **Multilingual Support**: Reach a broader audience by providing content in multiple languages, catering to various linguistic preferences and needs.
- **Auditory Engagement**: Offer an alternative for users who may have visual impairments or prefer listening over reading.

#### **Increased Engagement**

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Audio messages can be more engaging and personal, capturing users’ attention better than text alone.
- **Convenience**: Users can listen to messages on the go, making communication more flexible and accessible.

#### **Consistency and Professionalism**

- **Uniform Voice**: Ensure that all audio messages maintain a professional tone and clarity, consistent with your brand’s voice.
- **Template Integration**: Using a wrapper template for text-to-speech ensures that audio messages are delivered in a structured and organized manner.

#### **Localized Communication**

- **Cultural Relevance**: By offering messages in different languages, you can connect with users on a cultural level, improving the effectiveness of your communication.

#### **Efficient Content Delivery**

- **Time Savings**: Automate the conversion of text to speech, reducing the need for manual audio recording and editing.

The Text-to-Speech feature in Kursaha provides a versatile and effective way to enhance your messaging strategy. By utilizing multiple language options and integrating TTS within WhatsApp using wrapper templates, you can deliver engaging and accessible audio content to a diverse audience, fostering better communication and connection.
