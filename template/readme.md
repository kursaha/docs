## How to Create a Template

Before creating a template, make sure that you have a valid datasource and query.

### Placeholder Format

When writing a template, it is important to use proper placeholders. The format for placeholders should be as follows: `[(${value})]`. Here, `value` is the query mapping name that you have given to build the query.
