## How to Generate and Use a Mailkeets API Key

This guide explains how to generate a Mailkeets API key and how to use it for authentication purposes. Before you begin, please make sure you have a Mailkeets account. If you don't have one, please create an account.

## Generating a Mailkeets API Key

To create a new Mailkeets API key, follow the steps below:

1. Go to the <a href="https://kursaha.com/mailkeets/api-key/new" target="_blank">Mailkeets API key creation page</a>
2. Enter a key name for identification purposes.
3. Click on the "Save" button to generate the API key.

Once you have successfully generated a Mailkeets API key, make sure to store it securely. Please note that for security reasons, Mailkeets does not store the API key on its server.


##### Using the Mailkeets API Key

The Mailkeets API key is a secret key that you can use for authentication purposes when interacting with Mailkeets through the API. You can use our [MailSdk](./MailSdk.md) to integrate Mailkeets into your application.

Keep in mind that the Mailkeets API key should be treated as a sensitive information and should not be shared with anyone who doesn't need access to it.
