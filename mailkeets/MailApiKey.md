# Set Mail Api Key
This page explains how to create a Mailkeets api key and how to use that key. Before you begin, If you do not have any Mailkeets account please create one.

### Create an api key
  [!button Create](https://kursaha.com/mailkeets/api-key/new)

Please enter a key name identification. After that, click on [!badge Save]() button. You have successfully generated a mail api key from our system :tada:.

##### There are few things to remember
- Mailkeets api key is a secret key used for authentication purpose.
- For security reason, we do not store the api key in our server. You have to store the api key in a secure place. 

After you create a Mailkeets api key, you can use our [sdk](./MailSdk.md) to integrate with mailkeets.
