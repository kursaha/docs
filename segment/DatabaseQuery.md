# Database Query

Database query segments involve dividing a database query into smaller, more manageable parts. This approach allows you to focus on specific subsets of data rather than processing the entire dataset at once.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Segmentation Criteria:** Data can be divided based on criteria like time periods, geographic regions, customer demographics, or product categories.
- **Segmented Queries:** Each segment targets a particular subset of data, improving efficiency and relevance in data retrieval.

Effective data management and analysis are crucial for making informed business decisions. Database query segments and table mappings are key strategies to optimize how you handle and retrieve data. By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can streamline your data operations, improve performance, and gain actionable insights.

## **Benefits of Database Query Segments:**

1. **Enhanced Query Performance:** Smaller, targeted queries reduce the processing load and speed up data retrieval.
2. **Improved Data Management:** Managing smaller data subsets is easier and reduces error risks.
3. **Greater Analysis Flexibility:** Detailed analysis of specific segments uncovers trends and insights.
4. **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Distributing the processing load leads to cost savings and better use of infrastructure.
5. **Streamlined Reporting:** Focused segments simplify the creation of accurate and relevant reports.

## **What are Table Mappings?**

Table mappings involve defining relationships between different tables within a database. This process ensures that data from multiple tables can be accurately linked and queried, facilitating comprehensive data analysis and reporting.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Defining Relationships:** Mapping defines how tables are connected, such as through primary and foreign keys.
- **Data Integration:** Effective mapping integrates data from various sources, enabling a unified view and analysis.

## **Implementing Database Query Segments**

Kursaha provides robust tools to help you effectively implement both database query segments and table mappings:

1. Access Database Query by navigating to the 'Segment' section and selecting 'Create New Segment,' then choose 'Database Query'
2. Specify the required fields. Choose the database you want to choose, for creating database [see demo here]().
3. Write a query to access tables, sheets etc from the database. And click on run query.
4. After succesfull execution of query, click on `Next` and maps the column.Some of the mappings needed are id, name, email, phoneNumber, firstName, lastName, zipcode, fcm_token, web_token, apn_token. And click on `Save`.
5. After succesful creation of segment, click on _three dots_ to create campaign or trigger journey according to your needs.
